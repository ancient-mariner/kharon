This is the kharon app, including multiprocessing kernel and modules.

core_modules/
Modules to computer attitude (eg, intertial sensors) as well as those 
that directly use attitude.

include/
Header files for kernel and modules

kernel/
App core

lib/
Module libraries that are part of core (e.g., attitude)

routing/
Modules for route generation

tracking/
Modules for optical tracking

util/
Source for utilities, plus scripts, for analyzing log data

------------------------------------------------

Code in 'kernel', 'core_modules' and 'routing' should be cross-platform and
able to be run on both primary and secondary computers (eg, main 
processing computer and RPI). 

'tracking' is computationally intensive and is expected to run only on
a primary computer (e.g., intel i-7), and hopefully in future on a hybrid
arrangement w/ either GPU or FPGA
