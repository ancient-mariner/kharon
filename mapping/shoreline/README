Shoreline data is from
   http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/
and can be downloaded at
   https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/data/gshhg/latest/
Licensing information is in the downloaded data

The important part of this package is the shoreline data, which is stored
in shapefiles. To read using python, this requires the package 'python-pyshp'

The extract_shapes.py file extracts the shape information and puts it into
an easily parsible txt file. Each line of the file contains the next point
in a polygon, and polygons are separated by a line starting with '#'.

TODO what's needed is a tool to read this text file and, for each line segment,
draw the shoreline in the highest resolution map (eg, level-3)
