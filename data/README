The data directory is for storing output data, including logs and 
image data. Because of the potentially large amount of data to be
logged, 'data' should be on a separate partition and/or drive and
mounted as '/data/'. The folder structure here should be recreated
in /data.

archive/
Source code archives

dev/
Device data

env/
Environment folders

logs/
Direct output from the running app, with directories created every
time the app starts. Directories names are timestamps.
The directories here should be cleaned out periodically, when no longer
needed, to help manage disk space.

recordings/
For storing log directories that have signficance or that are to be
kept around for longer term. Examples of this are log directories that
will be analyzed later or that are to be replayed, such as for testing.
